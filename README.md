Automatic Attendance system using raspberry pi model B3
## Run datasetgen.py to generate data set of faces from you webcam.
## Run datatrain.py to train captured face features and serialized .yum file.
## Run facedetector.py to validate model , webcam will search for the trained faces.
This model can further improved using Convolutional Neural Network for generating more features.
